# Blockchain Homework

The two parts of this assignment are in the two respective folders. 

The case study is under the Lightspeed Case Study and it is saved as a docx file and also in the readme file.

The POA blockchain part of the assignment is under the POA Dev Chain folder.

The screenshots of a successful transaction and the setup using the terminal are in the screenshots folder.  

The Blockchain-Tools folder was also uploaded to show the .json files from setting up the blockchain.

In the readme.md file in that folder is where the steps I took are laid out, along with the screenshots.
